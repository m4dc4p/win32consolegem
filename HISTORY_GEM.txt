1.1.1 - Updates from Luis Lavena (luislavena at gmail dot com) to ensure 'pure ruby' version
   of gem is provided. 
1.1.0 - Bug fixes provided by Gordon Thiesfeld (gthiesfeld at gmail dot com).
  * added #putc to Win32::Console::ANSI::IO 
    This putc buffers escape sequences so that they will be handled properly
  *added Kernel#putc
    Redefined Kernel#putc to wrap Win32::Console::ANSI::IO#putc
  *added #redirected? to Win32::Console::ANSI::IO
    Checks the mode of the console to see if IO is being redirected or not
  * fixed "Invalid Handle" error in compiled version of GetConsoleMode
    I'm actually not sure of the source of this error.  It may be expected behavior when output is being redirected.  I worked around it by rescuing the exception in Win32::Console#Mode and returning 9999.  I picked that arbitrary value, because it is higher than 31, which is what I think is the highest value Mode would return if output isn't being redirected.
  * modified Win32::Console::ANSI::IO#write
  to check for redirection.  If output is redirected, it uses WriteFile instead of  WriteConosle.  It also skips the parsing step, and passes the escape sequences through.
  * added Win32::Console::API#WriteFile
    to both the Ruby and compiled versions
  * added Win32::Console*WriteFile
  This is a wrapper around Win32::Console::API#WriteFile
  * modified Win32::Console::ANSI::IO#_PrintString
  Didn't change behavior, just tried to make it more idiomatic ruby.  I didn't make all of the changes I wanted to, because I wasn't sure how to test them all.
  * split Win32::Console::Constants and Win32::Console::API out into seperate files.
  These two classes were in 'Win32/Console.rb'  I moved them into 'Win32/Console/constants.rb' and 'Win32/Console/api.rb' respectively.
  * cleaned up indentation
  indentations was a mixture of tabs and spaces.  I made everything indented with 2 spaces.
  * modified all Win32::Console::API methods
  It was assigning Win32API functions to class variables.  I switched them to instance variables. I also changed the idiom it was using to instantiate the objects.
  For instance, instead of:
  
    if @@m_AllocConsole == nil
    @@m_AllocConsole = Win32API.new( "kernel32", "AllocConsole", 
            [], 'l' )
            
  It is now:
  
    @AllocConsole ||= Win32API.new( "kernel32", "AllocConsole", [], 'l' )
  * Non-string arguments passed to Win32::Console::ANSI#write caused error - fix by Ivan Evtuhovich (evtuhovich at gmail dot com).

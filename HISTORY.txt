v1.0 - Added .dup to _printString function to avoid mangling outside
       string references.  Removed the other (later) .dup call.
       Turned of some exceptions that were conflicting with using
       the module with pipes or redirections.
v0.8 - Fixed bugs in reading routines, added ruby docs, and 
       sample test suite.
v0.5 - First public release.
